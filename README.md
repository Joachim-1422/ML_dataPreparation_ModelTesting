# ML_dataPreparation_ModelTesting

This project was a machine learning project for a Machine learning courses in Algebra College.

For this project, I had to demonstrate how to select some important features and show some data preparation techniques.
After that, I had to uses SVM models on the Health App data. And for the soil prediction, I Just tried some Regression Models as a demonstration.
