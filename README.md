# ML_dataPreparation_ModelTesting

This project was a machine learning project for a Machine learning courses in Algebra College.

For this project, I had to demonstrate how to select some important features and show some data preparation techniques.
After that, I had to uses SVM models on the Health App data. And for the soil prediction, I Just tried some Regression Models as a demonstration.

You can contact me if you want the data to test it but the notebook only should be sufficient for the understanding of techniques.

This project had been done in January 2020.
